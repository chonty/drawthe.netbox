Generate [drawthe.net](https://github.com/cidrblock/drawthe.net) diagrams from [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) data.

Very basic right now.  To test, edit the Netbox API details with your own, edit the device filter and role_y to match a portion of your network.  Chuck the output into http://go.drawthe.net/
